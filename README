HTTP::Headers::UserAgent v3.00

  Copyright (c) 2001 Ivan Kohler.  All rights reserved.
  This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it
  under the same terms as Perl itself.

This is a class that deals with the HTTP User-Agent header.  It will parse
the header, and (hopefully) report the correct platform, operating system,
browser, and browser version.

This is version 3.00 of the HTTP::Headers::UserAgent class.  It is now
depriciated, and the code is a wrapper around the more well-maintained
HTTP::BrowserDetect module.  You are advised to switch to HTTP::BrowserDetect.
While the interface provides backward-compatibility with version 1.00, it is
not based on the 1.00 code.

To install:
  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test # nothing substantial yet
  make install

Documentation will then be available via `man HTTP::Headers::UserAgent' or
`perldoc HTTP::Headers::UserAgent'.

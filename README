This is a class that deals with the HTTP User-Agent header.  It will parse
the header, and (hopefully) report the correct platform, operating system,
browser, and browser version.

This is version 2.00 of the HTTP::Headers::UserAgent class.  While the
interface provides backward-compatibility with version 1.00, it is not based
on the 1.00 code.

To install:
  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test # nothing substantial yet
  make install

Documentation will then be available via `man HTTP::Headers::UserAgent' or
`perldoc HTTP::Headers::UserAgent'.

NAME
    HTTP::Headers::UserAgent - Routine to detect web browser
    platform from User-Agent HTTP Header

SYNOPSIS
            use HTTP::Headers::UserAgent;
            $Platform = new HTTP::Headers::UserAgent::GetPlatform ($ENV{HTTP_USER_AGENT});

DESCRIPTION
    The route will parse parameter string, which must be in HTTP
    User-Agent header form, and return the browser platform. The
    returned value is string with one of the following values:

            Win95, Win98, WinNT, UNIX, MAC, Win3x, OS2, Linux

    If the platform is not one of these (i.e. one of the robots),
    the returned string is empty.

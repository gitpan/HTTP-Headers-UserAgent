HTTP::Headers::UserAgent v3.00

Copyright (c) 2001 Ivan Kohler.  All rights reserved.
This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under
the same terms as Perl itself.

This is a class that deals with the HTTP User-Agent header.  It will parse
the header, and (hopefully) report the correct platform, operating system,
browser, and browser version.

This is version 3.00 of the HTPP::Headers::UserAgent class.  <FONT SIZE="+2"><B>It is now
depriciated</B></FONT>, and the code is a wrapper around the more well-maintained
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?dist=HTTP-BrowserDetect">HTTP::BrowserDetect module</a>.  You are advised to switch to <a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?dist=HTTP-BrowserDetect">HTTP::BrowserDetect</a>.
While the interface provides backward-compatibility with version 1.00, it is
not based on the 1.00 code.

To install:
	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test # nothing substantial yet

Documentation will then be available via `man HTTP::Headers::UserAgent' or
`perldoc HTTP::Headers::UserAgent'.
